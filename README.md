# Discontinuation Notice
This project is unfortunately discontinued and will remain archived. Thank you NoradTF2 for attempting to bring back Uber Upgrades gamemode.

For more information about what happened, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/RoonMoonlight/Fixed-Uber-Upgrades/issues/1).

# Fixed Uber Upgrades
This is a public modification and continuation of Uber Upgrades by NoradTF2. This is considered as continuation of Uber Upgrades.

If you want to run it, add "sm plugins reload tf2attributes_ubup" to server.cfg so your uberupgrades will actually load every time your server restarts or map changes.

# Prerequisites
You'll need these plugins:
* [TF2Attributes](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes/releases)
* [TF2Items](https://builds.limetech.io/?project=tf2items)
* [TFEconData](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconData)
* [TFEconDataCompat](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconDataCompat)
* [Dhooks](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2588686&postcount=589)

If you want to compile the plugin itself, you need TF2ItemsInfo include (tf2itemsinfo.inc) file too.
